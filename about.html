        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="graph">
          <p>Currently a student in Galvanize's Web Development Immersive program,
            intent on entering the tech industry as a full stack developer. I
            find every level of the field to be utterly fascinating, from the
            constant evolution of languages and frameworks to their practical
            implementation in the real world.</p>

          <p>I thrive where creative enterprise meets practical application.
            Recent job experience includes managing two non-profit theatre
            companies: Vintage Theatre and Theatre Esprit Asia. I've taken great
             pride in developing into a manager who can make sure all of the
             "little" things are taken care of so the business can go smoothly
             and the show can go on without a hitch.</p>

          <p>My time at Vintage is my proudest professional achievement. I
            entered the company in 2015 and found an organization weighed down
            by the standard challenges of a fledgling 501(c)3 company -
            understaffed, overworked, and existing in a constant state of peril.
            Through a myriad of contributions, the theatre enjoyed massive
            growth in several key metrics during my tenure. Now it's in the
            strongest position of its nearly 20 year history. I personally
            refined and modernized several key areas of the operation, including
            our online presence, marketing initiatives, and bar sales. All of
            this in addition to running the box office, managing staff &
            volunteers, and performing a vast amount of administrative functions
            at a high level.</p>

          <p>Additionally, I've worked as a bartender, barista, music
            journalist, and DJ. I graduated Colorado State with a BS in
            English (Creative Writing). My free time is spent on concerts,
            sports, cooking and reading. Oh, and I'm allergic to ALL the
            animals. No one's perfect!</p>
