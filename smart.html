        <h2>SMART Goals</h2>
        <h3>"SMART" Goals? Is that an ackronym or something?</h3>
        <p>Pretty much, yeah. In a nutshell, it's a method of setting goals that are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>S - Specific
          <li>M - Measurable
          <li>A - Attainable
          <li>R - Realistic
          <li>T - Timely
        </ul>
        <p>Why do they matter? Well, you use SMART Goals to write better to-do
          lists. And I'm a big fan of to-do lists.
        </p>
        <p>To-do lists should push us to do our most important work by way of
          telling us how to get that work done. They should also be designed to
          tell you what to do next after a task is completed.
        </p>
        <p>So at the start of each day, the idea is that you're setting goals
          that adhere to the 5 SMART principles above. In doing so, you're
          setting benchmarks that are ambitious but sensible - you're not
          cheating yourself by lining up a bunch of easy tasks (and then
          thinking that completing them means you accomplished something), but
          you're also not setting yourself up for disappointment by creating
          unreasonable expectations you simply can't meet.
        </p>
        <p>SMART Goals should derive from one big, ambitious "stretch" goal.
          Ideally, they should take that goal and break it down into smaller,
          achievable components.
        </p>
        <h2>Drill 1 (from 2/26/18)</h2>
        <div class="graph">
          <p>Goals for Monday, 2/26/18:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>(Main priority) Resubmit CLI drill 2 and 3, as well as Git drill 1. If
              returned again failing, resubmit.
            </li>
            <li>Identify and enroll in 3 coding meet ups that will take place by
              next Thursday (3/8)
            </li>
            <li>Attend intermediate CSS breakout
            </li>
            <li>Work through no less than two CSS materials in standards
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Were the Goals Met? - Yes. I finished my resubmissions, have all
            of my meet ups set up (and attended the first one at that), went to
            the breakout and worked through my CSS materials.
          </p>
          <p>What Went Well? - I’m pleased that I was able to work through all
            four goals. It felt like a realistic-yet-robust schedule for the
            day and I feel like it led to a lot of productivity. So that’s a
            win. I’m particularly happy that I was able to identify and
            schedule all the meet ups I need to take care of - even attending a
            Python meet up the same day that I would have otherwise missed - so
            I can have a relatively easy standard on track for completion.
            Another win.
          </p>
          <p>What Didn't Go Well? - I’m not sure the CSS breakout was the most
            productive use of my time. As it turns out I knew a lot of the
            material being reviewed already. I need to be more discerning with
            the breakouts I choose to attend and allocate time spent to sessions
            that are going over new/relevant material to me, or reviewing things
            I’m not quite getting (or worse). This one didn’t fall into either
            of those categories and I could have put that time toward getting my
            multi-page websites going.
          </p>
          <p>What Will I Do Differently Tomorrow? - As you might expect, I’ll
            be working toward getting those multi-page drills started above all.
            Want to get coding on those before the end of day.
          </p>

        <h2>Drill 2 (From 2/27/18)</h2>
        <div class="graph">
          <p>Goals for Tuesday, 2/27/18:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>(Main priority) Finish reviewing main materials for multi-page websites
            (Flexbox, Flexbox Froggy, Grid Garden) and begin working on Drill 1
            </li>
            <li>Type up review of Python meeting from 2/26
            </li>
            <li>Attend career services meet up at 1 pm.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Were the Goals Met? - Yes, all three. I worked through the three
            materials listed and nearly finished Drill 1. Submitted my review
            and attended the career services meeting as well.
          </p>
          <p>What Went Well? - I was satisfactorily pleased with how much I got
            through the 1st website drill. That was my big goal for the day and
            I was able to get most of it done, so I feel good about that. Total
            win. When I typed out the list I thought the career services meet up
            was optional. Turns out it wasn’t, but it was a great presentation
            that has me really excited for that aspect of the program (because
            I have gleefully ignored Twitter and LinkedIn prior to now). So not
            a win in the sense of an ambitious goal, but definitely worth doing
            and deeply appreciated.
          </p>
          <p>What Didn't Go Well? - I think that, particularly after hearing from instructors
          and students regarding this matter the past few days, I could have set the
          stage for the website drills even better. Specifically: I still kind of jumped
          into things without really knowing flex box well enough, just for the sake of
          adhering to my arbitrarily-designed schedule. Definitely got stuck a few times.
          I probably would have been better served to do some more homework on flex box
          before getting started.
          </p>
          <p>What Will I Do Differently Tomorrow? - Attend a flex box/CSS breakout for some
          supplementary info! Apart from that, I’m going to continue working through the
          website drills. Hopefully I can finalize #1 and make strong headway through #2
          - but with a greater willingness to take a step back and review things or ask
          for help if I get stuck. And I’ll probably review my notes on CSS and Semantic
          HTML before getting started.

          <h2>Drill 3 (from 3/2/18)</h2>
          <p>Goals for Friday, 3/2/18:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>(Main priority) Revise and resubmit drills that are still Red (incl all Learn
          to Learn and probably all of the simple sites)
            </li>
            <li>Work through Functions and Loops on JS section in standards.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Were the Goals Met? - The important one was. All of the website drills were
        resubmitted. The Learn to Learn resubmissions and JS stuff though, not so much.
          </p>
          <p>What Went Well? - Well, I think finishing the sites is great. It was my goal
          to be done with the site drills not only for today, but for the week as a whole.
          I had all of my initial attempts submitted by end of yesterday, but none were
          passes. So my day was spent fixing all of the things, the scope of which I
          underestimated. Still, I think that at this point they are where they should
          be, or roughly 98% there. I will call that a win.
          </p>
          <p>Learning to use the W3C validators was pretty awesome. They caught some obvious
        problems with my initial code, but also pointed out things that I would never
        have thought about or taken seriously. A valuable tool I will definitely make
        use of frequently in the future. So that's a win as well.
          </p>
          <p>What Didn't Go Well? - As mentioned above, I really undershot how much time it would take to deal with
        my site drills. In fairness, I suppose, we were working in a somewhat narrower
        timeframe considering the presentation earlier today as well as getting out a
        little earlier on Friday. But, regardless, I never would have thought they would
        have taken up as much time as they did.
          </p>
          <p>What Will I Do Differently Tomorrow? - The truth is that I'm happy with the progress I made today. But obviously I was
        a little more ambitious in my planning than what was realistic. Duly noted that
        larger-scale drills will take up that much more time, and if I'm building a
        schedule around them I will take that into consideration.
