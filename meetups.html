        <h2>Meetups</h2>
        <p>Not what you know, but who you know, as it were. Building out a network
          of contacts in the tech world is so crucial to short and long term success
          that Galvanize actually made attendance mandatory (complete with written
          reflections). Here are 3 of mine.

          <h3>First Meetup: Let's Learn Some Python (2/26/18)</h3>
          <p>People I met - Met Steve, who has worked in coding for 19 years
            specializing in DBA, Oracle and mySQL. He is currently a contractor
            with Comcast. Comes to several of these. I also met Brian, who ran
            the class and is an instructor with Devetry. Seemed like a really
            good instructor.
          </p>
          <p>What I learned - The meet up was structured around building a
            hangman game with Python, and this was my first time ever using the
            code. So everything was definitely new! That said, I’d say my main
            takeaways were with Python syntax, variables, loops and if/elif/else
            statements. We had about an hour and a half to write the game out
            and barely made it through before the library closed at 8. It was
            very interesting to see a task I had already performed in the
            pre-course activities (building a hangman game in Javascript)
            replicated with a brand new language. A nice introductory point for
            me, I think.
          </p>
          <p>Questions - I have so many questions! Unsurprisingly I can’t help
            but compare Python to Javascript and the main thing sticking out to
            me is: does Python have a generally simpler and cleaner syntax than
            Javascript? My inital reaction is yes. But also, what are the ideal
            tasks for using Python? And is there really this big Python v.
            Javascript rivalry that the instructor seemed to imply? That’s
            really just the tip of the iceberg regarding my curiosity, but I’ll
            leave it there for now.

          <h3>Second Meetup - Front Range Front-End: CSS Basics - Selectors (3/1/18)</h3>
          <p>People I met - James Steinbach - UX Developer, DockYard; Dano Manion -
        Owner of Mahtay.com
          </p>
          <p>What I learned - I have to admit that this one didn't broaden my horizons that
            much since I've probably advanced past the point of needing a referendum on CSS
            selectors. Interestingly (or maybe expectedly?) the newest material dealt with
            learning selectors like 'of-type' that generally aren't used in production (at
            least according to James). Now, having said that, the last 10 minutes or so that
            covered some methods of how to use CSS to hack websites was very new and
            interesting from a technical standpoint.
          </p>
          <p>Questions - Questions relating to the meetup content would probably be focused on use cases
            for some of the lesser-known or used selectors. We did get a few but it was very
            cursory. And a question that is more related to the nature of meetups moreso
            than the content of last night's would be: when is a lecture-style meetup
            appropriate, vs. a code-along style meetup, vs. a socially-driven meetup? It was
            admittedly very dry to sit through this topic for an hour-and-a-half, and I
            definitely felt like it would have been more appropriate to at least break the
            lecture up with opportunities for the attendees to practice and/or implement
            what was being learned.

          <h3>Third Meetup: March Develop Happy Hour (3/13/18)</h3>
          <p>People I met: Quentin Hartman - Director of Infrastructure & DevOps at Finalze;
            Joe Simon - Promoter, Go Code Colorado
          </p>
          <p>What I Learned - What sticks out is the conversation I had with Quentin regarding
            his company's approach to hiring and how it perceives developers coming out of the
            Galvanize program (or similar programs). He generally thought highly of Galvanize
            students, because they are entering the field with demonstrable experience and have
            already displayed a high level of initiative by completing the course (particularly
            as the culmination of a major career change). Apart from that, it was interesting
            to hear someone with his perspective speak to the continual need for new developers
            in the field, as well as how junior developers coming out of programs like Galvanize
            tend to work a little cheaper than others - an obvious plus for them.
          </p>
          <p>Setting that aside, I can't say I acquired a wealth of knowledge. But it was definitely
            cool to hang out with quite a few developers in a relaxed and casual setting. I
            also have to say I was impressed by all that there was to do - lots of games, for
            sure! Exceeded my expectations there.
          </p>
          <p>Questions - I suppose the biggest question I have is how useful these events directly are
            for getting hired when one eventually is a legitimate candidate for employment.
            I'm obviously a ways away yet, but when that day does arrive will it be realistic
            for me to look at these as a practical means of getting hired? Or just a bit of
            fun? Nothing wrong with the latter, of course! It was a pretty good time.
