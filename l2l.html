        <h2>Learn 2 Learn</h2>
        <h3>So what is Learn 2 Learn, anyway?</h3>
        <div class="intro">Engineers approach problems in a methodical and disciplined manner. That crucially extends to the "problem" of learning new things.
          <p>Learn 2 Learn is a process-driven approach to learning, built around 3 key components.</p>
          <h4>Set the stage</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Before reading or writing code, create an environment for maximum learning.</li>
              <li>Get rid of any distractions. Turn off your phone if you need to. Exit any unnecessary tabs on your browser (ahem, Facebook) and close out of any open programs that are unncessary.</li>
              <li>Take some time to clarify what you're specifically trying to learn, why you're doing it, and what your approach will be.</li>
            </ul>
          <h4>Play</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Play with the new technologies and information! Apply what you're learning! Make mistakes! If possible, have fun with it!</li>
              <li>The idea being: if you experiment with and apply the knowledge in real-time, you'll figure out what you know. But more importantly still, you'll do things wrong as well. This sort of failure allows you to discover gaps in your knowledge and identify where you need to go next to learn even more.</li>
              <li>Ultimately failure, mistakes, and miscues are opportunities to grow. As our 16th president said, "If you understand what you're doing, you're not learning anything."</li>
            </ul>
          <h4>Reflect</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Probably the most important part of this entire process is self-evaluation. Once you've finished reading, coding, or whatever learning task you've been working on, take some time to consider how things went.</li>
              <li>Consider how effective your setting of the stage was (or wasn't), review notes you took, summarize key information to yourself, and try to evaluate what you learned and how effective your approach was.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>What I'm Learning - I'm going to spend between 60 and 90
              minutes tonight (3/5) working through Galvanize Money practice
              drills. This is (well, I assume, anyway) intended to be a
              synthesis of the learning I've been doing on functions, arrays and
              objects. So I'm going to be furthering my knowledge of those JS
              features, and hopefully learning how to do this drill a bit better
              than I did this afternoon.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Setting the Stage -  Unfortunately I had a hard time getting
                this off the ground by myself earlier this afternoon, so I'll
                need to find some additional resources to further my learning
                and understanding of the concepts, not to mention my ability to
                complete the exercise. To that end, I'm going to look in the
                video database and see if any of the breakouts that focused on
                the drill are available online (or maybe there are other
                relevant videos).
                </p>
                <p>I'm working on this tonight in my home office. I've got my
                laptop, a second (larger) monitor hooked up, and my whiteboards
                hung on my wall to the side of my desk. I'm going to shut the
                door and let my girlfriend know I'll be in here about an hour
                and not to disturb me (sorry, babe!). Phone is turned off. I
                don't think I'll need anything open on my computer except for my
                notes, my text editor, my command line and Chrome - everything
                else can be closed out. Clear all tabs on my browser and in Atom
                and see if I can find a video in the database. Looks like
                there's one from Kim. Let's play that and hope I learn a thing
                or two as I code along.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Play - I basically tried to treat this session as if I was in
                the breakout. So I paid attention to what Kim was saying, and
                paused the clip when prompted to try writing the code. Full
                disclosure, I didn't do anything 100% properly. Came close in
                declaring the register object and reset function, but laughably
                off base with the functions addTransaction and getTotal. Yikes!
                BUT, after running my various (highly misguided) attempts at
                writing the functions and arrays, it was tremendously helpful to
                then be able to return to the video and see where I went wrong.
                I feel like I have at least an introductory understanding of
                what to do now with this sort of task, which is vastly superior
                to where I was mid-day - particularly in the logistical and
                pseudo-code approaches. Getting to take several failed stabs at
                writing the variables, objects, arrays and loops needed really
                helped me understand them better (sincerely). And as a nice
                bonus, I now know to use tabs when writing Atom to generate
                templates!
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Reflection - Setting the stage here worked really well. In
                particular, closing out of all the extraneous Chrome and Atom
                tags made it so much easier to quickly navigate around my
                environment, and thereby retain a strong overall focus.
                Incidentally, I really need to get better at managing my tabs
                in real-time, even in these contexts. 90 minutes after starting
                I now have 12 open! A lot of that is from Googling things
                related to the breakout video after it closed, but it's
                nonetheless a good indicator of how cluttered my browser can get
                in a short period of time. Oh, and my girlfriend told me she has
                much better things to do than bother me. She's a sweetheart.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Where I'll Go Next - Well, I need to keep working my way
                through the drill. And while the breakout video was invaluable
                to getting started, I'm not exactly at the point where I can now
                easily finish everything from here. I'll probably take a look at
                the "Learn Exercises" link tonight and review the notes I took
                on objects, arrays and functions as well. Hopefully I can work
                through the drill tomorrow.

                <p>What I'm Learning - Since my professional social media
                  profile really needs a boost, I'm going to spend an hour
                  before lunch today fleshing out my Talent and LinkedIn
                  profiles. I want to spend some time on these while yesterday's
                  presentation from career services is still fresh in my mind
                  and I'll need something to break up all of the Javascript,
                  anyway. So, in a sentence, I'm hoping to spend an hour or so
                  learning how to take my professional online presence from
                  "nonexistent" to "kinda sorta there."

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Setting the Stage - This is pretty simple. All I'll need are
                  my LinkedIn and Talent pages, in addition to a text editor and
                  Jess's presentation slides that she Slacked out. Pretty much
                  everything else can get cleared out or closed. I'm on the 4th
                  floor and it's a little noisy. I'll put in some headphones and
                  play something light in the background.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Play - I've never been on LinkedIn before, and even with the
                  Career Services presentation yesterday there's a lot to it.
                  Navigating everything is pretty alien. One of the first things
                  I do is list my old job as my current job, which takes me
                  about 5 minutes to fix. I add as many classmates as I can and
                  then I start thumbing through the contacts LinkedIn recognizes
                  via my email. I take some time picking and choosing, and then
                  realize the inefficiency of it all and opt to send out invites
                  to everyone in my list. There could be some unknown value in
                  there, though it will likely lead to my feed being a little
                  theatre/actor-dominant for a month or two.
                </p>
                <p>I add my job history going back to mid-college and now it's
                  the part I'm dreading: the summary. Obviously I'm not the
                  first person to loathe talking about himself in this context,
                  but still. I write out something, then rewrite, then rewrite
                  again. It's as neurotic as it seems. I quietly concede that
                  I'm not going to achieve perfection on it and move on.
                </p>
                <p>I realize I've spent most of the time on LinkedIn and switch
                  over to Talent. Talent seems to be far more concerned with
                  your work than your backstory, which is great both in a
                  general sense and because I can just plug in some cursory
                  data and feel like I've grown my page as much as possible.
                  Will be sure to get work on there ASAP when it's finished,
                  though.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Reflection - Well, it wasn't a total waste of time. I've
                  always felt like so much of learning how to use social media
                  is good old fashioned exposure therapy, so it was great to
                  play around and see what certain things and actions do - and
                  why that is. LinkedIn in particular is a bit disconcerting for
                  the uninitiated, but I can certainly understand now how
                  powerful of a tool it is for those in talent acquisition.
                </p>
                <p>In terms of setting the stage, I was thinking there would be
                  a little more potential for overlap between LinkedIn and
                  Talent but that's alright. Still, probably could have just
                  focused on one today, then the other down the road. External
                  distractions definitely weren't an issue, but I unwittingly
                  created one for myself by trying to juggle the two at the same
                  time. Still, there's a lot more professional content related
                  to me online now than there was at the start of the morning,
                  so that's okay with me.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Where I'll Go Next - At this point a professional photo is
                  the only thing completely missing. I'll have to scour my
                  social media profiles for something passable (and accurately
                  bald, of course). Naturally I'll be fine-tuning the copy as
                  the course progresses, and I really can't wait to post some
                  of my future projects on both.

              <li>
                <p>What I'm Learning - It's time to start the first section of
                  bucket 2: creating and manipulating DOM elements. I touched on
                  DOM in a very cursory sort of way during the pre-course work,
                  so while I'm not completely unfamiliar I suspect a lot of this
                  is going to be new territory. I'm going to start from the top,
                  resources-wise, and take a look at the section "DOM and DOM
                  manipulation."
                </p>
                <p>Opening up the lesson, there appears to be a video, plenty of
                  informative text and a few practice opportunities. This looks
                  like a great place to refresh my meager memory about the DOM,
                  get some new information, and practice in real-time.
                </p>
                <p>So let's begin learning about the DOM!</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Setting the Stage - Looks like I'll need to be on the lesson
                  page, have a text editor open in case I'm writing any code
                  during this, and a separate text editor to take a few notes. I
                  don't really think anything else will be necessary, so I'll
                  close and/or exit out of anything that doesn't directly
                  pertain to the drill.
                </p>
                <p>I'm going to head over to one of the basement isolation
                  booths and get started. Coffee is in tow, as I'm feeling a
                  little hazy this afternoon.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Play - I started with the video, which was a nice overview,
                  but didn't offer a whole lot by way of learning or practice
                  opportunities. Working through the material, I spent a good
                  90 minutes or so reading the material down to the end of
                  "Traversing The DOM" and then started taking a look at the
                  enclosed link "Traversing the DOM."
                </p>
                <p>Some good introductory information here. I didn't get to play
                  with much code, aside from the directions to go to MDN and run
                  some getElement and querySelector calls on MDN's page.
                  Probably generous to even say it was scratching the surface,
                  but as a starting point it will do.
                </p>
                <p>Apart from that, my "play" this time around was a lot of
                  reading, a lot of re-reading, and a lot of note-taking. Which
                  is fine! You gotta start somewhere.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Reflection - So I wasn't sure what to expect with the DOM
                  stuff, but, wow, this is a LOT. All I can say based off of
                  this session is that it is clearly a very powerful,
                  interesting, and essential API, and I look forward to really
                  rolling up my sleeves and writing some sweet code with it.

                <p>How effectively did I set the stage? I think I did fine. I
                  was expecting a little more out of the video, but as mentioned
                  it works as a jumping off point. External distractions weren't
                  an issue, but at the same time this stuff read in a pretty dry
                  manner. I had to check myself a few times to make sure I was
                  retaining focus, even with working in 3 5-minute breaks during
                  the session. I might retain more by breaking the reading up
                  into an even more segmented format as opposed to two
                  more-or-less straight hours of it. That said, I'm sure the
                  more I start actually coding, the focus fatigue issue will
                  naturally dissipate.

                <p>Where I'll Go Next - Forward! Next time I'll keep working
                  through the Traversing the DOM materials and spend some time
                  doing the drills at the end. After that I'll put eyes on the
                  linked articles on DOM and DOM events from MDN. Maybe after
                  that I'll take a shot at some exercises, or maybe even drill
                  1. There's a whole lot more ground to cover.
